<p>Page sample, for Ruffles Chips</p>

<h2 id="yeet-an-up-and-coming-startup-could-be-the-next-home-delivery-competitor"><a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a>, an up and coming startup, could be the next home delivery competitor.</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE: If you join Massdrop using</strong> <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS"><strong>our referral link</strong></a><strong>, you will get a $10 credit when you sign up. Links to Groupon are also</strong> <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66"><strong>referral links</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a> <em>“provides a liquidation platform where vendors can quickly sell overstocked products to our customers for a discounted price through our unique social buying experience.”</em></p>

<p>When you buy a product, you get it at a “pre-authorized” price. This means that this price is the highest that you will pay for that product. When more people come to buy the same product, the price drops. The price you actually pay is not always lower than the “pre-authorized” price, but it can never get higher. When the sale ends, you are charged for the ending price, and shipping starts.</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a> Has products from these categories, with more coming soon:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Baby</li>
  <li>Beverages</li>
  <li>Body</li>
  <li>Cleaning Supplies</li>
  <li>Electronics</li>
  <li>Groceries</li>
  <li>Health</li>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Pets</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that these categories may change at any time.</p>

<p>Some products are not guaranteed free shipping, and the time in which you get your products may take a matter of days. However, products on this site go for way cheaper, and this site is proud of their prices.</p>

<p>Under each listing is a price check from similar home delivery companies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>, <a href="https://www.jet.com/">Jet</a>, and <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, this isn’t the first time <a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a> has launched their service before. An Instagram post from September 18 last year show that <a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a> is launching their service for the second time. This can be a little suspicious, seeming that this is the same time as last year. However, their payments are secured by paypal, so if anything fishy goes on, you can get your money back.</p>

<p>In the past, <a href="https://medium.com/surfing-on-the-net/is-yeet-com-a-new-home-delivery-competitor-45b994382eba">YEET!</a> has offered 2-day shipping, but it is uncertain if this feature will carry over on the new launch. Currently, the website shows a shipping offer for free shipping on select items.</p>

<hr />

<p>How does <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a> compare to competitors like <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> and <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66">Groupon</a>?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> has the same crowd-based buying system like <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a>, where the more people who buy an item, the cheaper it gets. However, <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> has been around longer than <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a>, being founded in 2012. <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> partners with companies to make <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> exclusive products, which are usually cheaper than the off-site version.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4hBjMeEMU6x4faw0BdeAqQ.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> allows you to sign up to different “communities” which subscribe you to deals from a certain topic.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LiQAi0hxytUVIFz0ubI5bg.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> Categories</p>

<p>Not many categories from <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> and <a href="http://yeet%21/">YEET!</a> overlap, and it seems like <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> is appealing to the tech crowd, while <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a> is in the market for groceries and home supplies.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66">Groupon</a> works exactly the same way as the two previous services. However, instead of products, <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66">Groupon</a> deals with services, cash back coupons, and vouchers.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*1YLRazBwHH0Y3iQiLqXkjw.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>This is a whole new market all together, with new deals and ways to save money. <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66">Groupon</a> mainly partners with local businesses for cheaper deals.</p>

<hr />

<p>Which service should you choose? <a href="https://www.yeet.com/">YEET!</a> is in its infancy, and many things can change and become apparent in the near future. For now, I would use established companies like <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/?referer=YLGTTS">Massdrop</a> for technology purchases, and <a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/fcd4a25d-3e78-4800-9539-28dab6d85a66">Groupon</a>for local purchases.</p>
