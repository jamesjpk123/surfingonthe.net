  <div class="entry">
    <p>Everyone knows that a good speaker is <em>essential</em> to a good experience with computers and phones. Say you’re at a party and you whip out your phone. Open up your playlist that you made so everyone can have a good time. And then you realize that you don’t have a good speaker for everyone to hear your music! A party with no music is not great. Well, don’t worry because we have you covered. Here is a list of the best budget speakers in categories from the best looking speaker and best value!</p>

<p>We nominated the Cyber Acoustics 2.1 Subwoofer Speaker System. The stereo speakers have a sleek gloss black front with an open driver design. Most of the audio controls are on the “control pod”. It can turn the speakers on and off, volume controls and a quick connect 3.5mm jack for headphones.</p>

<p>The bass is controlled on the back of the dedicated subwoofer. It creates a comfortable amount of bass while being clear. You could definitely feel it, but it is not too overwhelming. You can get the volume and bass without the price tag. It is $24.51 + tax and S&amp;H which includes a 1-year warranty.</p>

<p>Here we have the AmazonBasics Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. The AmazonBasics line of products by Amazon is known for their quality products at more than reasonable prices.</p>

<p>The speaker has a measly 8-hour playtime so you better remember to charge it! It also has a 33 foot (10 meters) range which is standard in budget wireless speakers. This does not boast any protection features either. It does have an AUX port for any devices not equipped with Bluetooth (AUX cord not included). The buttons on the top only include volume control, power, Bluetooth connect, and phone function.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a built-in microphone for hands free-calling which is a neat feature that more speakers should have. The features do seem lacking but this is a budget speaker. It has two 2.5 watt drivers which sound amazing for the size and price! Speaking about the price, the speaker comes with 3 different color options, Red, Blue, and Black. The prices are $16.10, $25.99, and 19.99 + tax and S&amp;H respectively.</p>

<h4 id="best-smart-speaker">Best Smart Speaker</h4>

<p>When you think smart speaker you generally think Amazon or Google right? Well think Zolo Halo.</p>

<p>The Zolo Halo is made by Anker which is a respected brand when it comes to sound. The Zolo Halo does run Alexa so you won’t have any disappointing A.I. Where the Halo gets really special is sound. It flaunts one 5 watt “high-excursion” driver with its own bass port!</p>

<p>The Halo claims room-filling sound. It also has all of the features an Alexa would have such has smart home control, news, weather, take out, music streaming, and much more. If you do choose to get more than one, there is an option to sync all of your Halos. <em>“Go seamlessly from singing in the shower to dueting while you dry or listening while you lounge”</em>.</p>

<p>You can stream music from Amazon Music, iHeart Radio, Tunein, Spotify Premium, and Pandora. The top features two microphones, volume controls buttons and a voice activation button. The Halo can also be used like a stand-alone speaker through Bluetooth if you like. You will have to get The Zolo Play app because that is responsible for tasks such as getting the weather and setting a timer. But the Alexa app is also required to play music, get skills, and setting up 3rd party smart home devices. And if the Alexa A.I does not suit you, there is a Zolo Mojo with Google Assistant. However, when this article was made, the Mojo was unavailable. The Zolo Halo comes with an 18-month warranty at a price unbeatable. On Amazon.com the price is $19.99 + tax and S&amp;H.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jjvsNbG_ho5EyB0N7aDWAg.jpeg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>The Mpow Portable Bluetooth Speaker takes the cake in this category. The body is mostly constructed of plastic and metal. It is rated at IP65 splash protection. It is also shockproof and dustproof. The Mpow is not messing around here. The button selection on the top is a power button, and two volume controls that double as track skipping if you hold them. It provides a decent battery life of 10 hours. Where it gets really interesting is the 1000 mAh emergency battery. That is enough to charge a Samsung Galaxy S9 or iPhone X one-third of the way! The speaker is just one 5 watt driver which is loud enough to have a picnic next to a fast river. It connects via Bluetooth or 3.5mm jack. A 45-day money back and 18-month warranty comes with every Mpow. The orange color is $16.99 while the blue one is $22.99 + tax and S&amp;H.</p>

<h4 id="best-looking-speaker">Best Looking Speaker</h4>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G4KAYCBH0dYlKx0K_-N9ew.jpeg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>If you are looking for something flashy to show off to your friends, look no further than the MIANOVA 22A. The 5 watt driver fires upwards because the sides are covered in multi-theme LEDs! The LEDs do not adapt to the music that is playing but there are different color changing themes.</p>

<p>Those include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ocean (Blue)</li>
  <li>Grass (Green)</li>
  <li>Flame (Red)</li>
  <li>Season Changes</li>
  <li>Sea Water and Flame</li>
  <li>Silent Night Sky</li>
</ul>

<p>You can manually change through the themes or let it change through. The speaker as 10 hours of playtime with the LEDs off, 8 hours when they are on. The controls buttons are on the bottom of the speaker which include a skip track/volume up, back/volume down, LED light controller, play/pause/mode, and power. The speaker does have a built-in microphone for hands free calling. Music can be played via Bluetooth, AUX cord, TF card (micro SD card), and USB. It also features TWS (True Wireless Stereo) which means if you have two, they get treated like a left speaker and a right one. The speaker is $25.99 + tax and S&amp;H.</p>

With 66 feet (20 meters) range, you can listen to your music all of the time. A very durable build allows for a sturdy and worry free design. The top buttons feature an on/off button, Bluetooth connect, pause/play, and volume control. With a built-in microphone, this really is the complete package. The Anker Soundcore is $25.99 + tax and S&amp;H.</p>
