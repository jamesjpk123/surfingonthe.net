Hello! This is going to be the future home for a (blog?). I'm not really sure what form this will take yet, but for now it is a work in progress.

If you want to look at what I am doing currently, you can check out my twitter [@JamesKerrane](https://twitter.com/JamesKerrane), or my scrapbook at [scrapbook.jameskerrane.com](https://scrapbook.jameskerrane.com) where I am posting what I am currently making this summer.

Thank you! ðŸ˜„
