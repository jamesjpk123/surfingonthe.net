The Ghostek NRGbag 2 series is a really good looking bag with about 40 L of storage. That is more than enough to carry around whatever you would possibly need. The bag is also waterproof so there is no worry about ruining your electronics or other precious items. The greatest feature about this bag is the included 16,000 mAh rechargeable battery that can easily charge your phone at least 4 times.

There are three female USB connectors, two inside the backpack and one on the outside of the backpack so you can walk anywhere with your phone in your hand, while it is charging. The battery is charged via a micro USB on the outside of the backpack.

You can start charging your electronics by pressing the button on the strap of the backpack which has 3 light bars indicated battery life of the portable battery.

The three colors are available in Black, Camouflage, or Teal for $79.95 + tax and S&H.

If you are a nut in audio, you probably know the name Sennheiser. Even if you are not, you may have heard of them. If you have not, Sennheiser is up there with some of the best audio brands such as B&O and Audio Technica. The Sennheiser HD 4.40 wireless headphones connect via Bluetooth or AUX cable which is included.

The battery life is a gracious 25 hours of playtime so you can jam out to your tunes all day and night. The battery charges with an included micro USB cable. The “around ear” design might be uncomfortable for people with larger ears but the pads should either cover your ears or sit on them.

The HD 4.40s do not have active noise canceling (real noise canceling) but they do have passive noise canceling (the design of the headphones keep sound in and keep outside sounds out).

With a minimalist design, the Sennheiser HD 4.40 Headphones are $99.95 + tax and S&H.

When sitting in a lecture hall, sometimes the professor can talk too fast, or you might miss something. With a sound audio recorder like this one, you can write more thorough notes, and make sure that you’re not missing anything.

Before you buy one, make sure that the University that you go to doesn’t already record lectures, and that you are allowed to record your professors. With this audio recorder, just plug it into your PC/MAC and drag the audio files over. This comes with 15–18 hours of recording on one charge.

This goes for $29.80 + tax and S&H.

This ASUS VivoBook is one of the best budget laptops out there. A powerful 8th generation Intel Core i5–8250U powers programs like Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator easily. The beefy processor is 1.6GHz with a turbo up to 3.4Ghz. With an 80% screen-to-body ratio and a sleek 0.8” thin footprint, this laptop is super powerful.

One super impressive part of this laptop is its built-in fingerprint sensor. This sensor can be used for logging in, shopping, authentication, and more! For a work laptop, this is the best price to performance ratio that we’ve seen.

This laptop is available for $509.99+ tax and S&H, or $102/mo./5mo, a pricing plan fit for college students on a tight budget.

The Essential Phone was released on May 30rd, 2017 to be a very sleek and modern. It ran stock Android, the only other phone that does besides the Google Pixel. The problem was the phone had too many bugs and could not keep up performance wise with other flagships. For the steep price of $699, I can see why the Essential phone did not do too well. But the price has been lowered to a jaw dropping $344.87! Enough about the history, let’s talk about the phone.

Where to start with the Essential Phone. The screen is tucked all the way to the top with a little camera bump that is really unintrusive. The screen is also touching the two sides to almost make a full screen front besides the chin on the bottom. The build is made of titanium which is used to replace bones or build planes! The back is ceramic and the screen has the outstanding Gorilla Glass 5. This phone is really durable and with a great look. Going onto the back of the Essential Phone, it features 2 13 megapixel cameras that can take 4K video at 30fps. The front facing camera is a standard 8 megapixel sensor. There is a fingerprint sensor on the back below the cameras. You will never run out of storage with an astounding 128GB standard on the phone and with 4GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, you are getting close to flagship performance. The phone is IP65 water resistant and with an “all day battery life” you can really take this phone on adventures! This phone is just an amazing phone and if I were in the market for a phone, no matter the budget, I would choose this one.
