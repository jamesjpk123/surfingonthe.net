title: "Are AmazonBasics new gaming products any good?"
---

AmazonBasics is Amazon’s generic brand. They sell great items without the name brands. Recently, Amazon released a few new gaming focus products for the people on a budget.

#### **AmazonBasics Gaming Keyboard (K690)**

The new AmazonBasics Gaming Keyboard or the K690 has a “mechanical feel” to it. Now typically the mechanical feel advertised keyboards do not feel anything close to true mechanical switches.
Sometimes they even feel worse than classic membrane keyboards (the type you are probably using, squishy feeling and the most common). So be careful before buying this keyboard, may not satisfy your needs.

The AmazonBasics Gaming Keyboard does feature the close to mechanical key switch life at 10 million “life-cycles” or clicks. The WASD and arrow keys are different colored (very common in gaming keyboards), keycaps being a silver color while the rest of the keys are black.

There are 5 keys on the left side of the keyboard going up and down that are programmable to do whatever you want them to. You can program the keys within the included software that you can get either online or through a CD with the keyboard.

The RGB lights are also controlled through the program. Yes, the keyboard does come with 16.8 million different color variation which is true RGB. The light colors and patterns are fully customizable.

On the top of the K690, there are 3 buttons labeled M1, M2, and M3. Those are the three memory setting that you can choose in the program. It stores your backlight settings, programmable G keys, etc. The K690 is not a bad choice for gamers on a budget.

The AmazonBasics Gaming Keyboard is only $24.41 + tax and S&H.

The new AmazonBasics Multi-Color Gaming Mouse looks like a somewhat ordinary mouse besides the more “gamer esque” design with a few RGB color accents.

Like the keyboard, the Gaming Mouse has fully customizable RGB lights and a couple programmable buttons. In the AmazonBasics Gaming Mouse, it features has Omron switches (some of the best on the market) with a 50 million click-span.

On the top, there is a dedicated button for switching the DPI (Dots Per Inch, essentially the speed of the cursor) from 200, 400, 1200, 1600, 2400, and 3200.

Not included with the mouse, AmazonBasics now has a “Gaming Mouse Pad”. I will be honest, I am not too sure what differentiates a gaming mouse pad from a “non-gaming one”. Maybe it it is the feature like RGB or wireless charging, but I digress.

The Mouse Pad comes in a Standard size, Mini, Extended, and XXL. It is a flexible mouse pad for portability but that does not mean it has bad build quality. The AmazonBasics Gaming Mouse is $23.99 + tax and S&H which is kind of steep for a mouse but you do get what you pay for. The mouse pad is $6.99 for the standard size, 5.99 for the mini size, $23.99 for the extended mouse pad, and $10.99 for the XXL size.

Those were the three new gaming products for the AmazonBasics lineup. Comment if you bought any of them and of course, have a great day!
