Amazon and Netflix are both considering the acquittal of Landmark Theaters, an adult-oriented atmosphere, according to their website. Landmark shows independent, foreign, 3D, and smart films from Hollywood. These are lesser-known films, and not the blockbusters you see at traditional theaters like AMC and Cinemark.
Landmark is an almost perfect match for the original movies that Amazon and Netflix produce, and will likely be shown along with the other films that Landmark showcases if the acquittal goes through. However, since both companies are in the discussion stage currently, it is not certain that Landmark will be acquitted at all.
This comes after the news that Steven Spielberg thinks that Netflix Movies shouldn’t qualify for Oscars. In Oscar’s official rules for the 91st Academy Awards, it is said that “to be eligible for 91st Academy Awards consideration, a documentary feature must complete
both a seven-day theatrical release in Los Angeles County and a seven-day theatrical release in
the City of New York during the eligibility period. “
This ruleset for eligibility may be bypassed by winning a qualifying award at a film festival that the Oscar’s approve.
Currently, Netflix gives films limited theatrical releases to qualify for these film shows, because the reward for qualifying is huge. According to Fandango, ticket sales for best picture nominees rose after the Oscar nominees were announced last week.

“[The Shape of Water](https://www.foxmovies.com/movies/the-shape-of-water?utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_campaign=the-shape-of-waterhe-phy#bluray)”, a film with the most nominations of any movie in 2018”, had a 241% increase in ticket sales.
There’s big money in the Oscars, and it is worth it to participate. With an acquittal of Landmark Theaters, Amazon and Netflix would have the substantial benefits of owning a theatre chain, like announcing perks, and creating hype.
Amazon could bundle perks with Amazon Prime, or Netflix could make you pay a premium to see movies before they come out on Netflix in theaters. With the domination of brick-and-mortar theatres and home theaters, media companies can perfect the experience of both.
This comes in line with a new Amazon Go brick-and-mortar store coming to 5th Ave & Marion, in Seattle this fall.
The fusion of brick-and-mortar stores with digital storefronts will make technology more seamless with our daily lives.
