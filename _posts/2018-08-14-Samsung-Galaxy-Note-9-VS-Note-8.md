Some people were not impressed with the release of the Galaxy S9. Although the S9 is a great phone, it just was not that different from the S8. The Note 9 was announced on August 9, and once again, it looks very similar to the Note 8. Even the release dates are similar. The Note 8 was released on August 23rd, 2017, while the Note 9’s release date will be August 24th, 2018! So, is the Note 9 really better than the Note 8? Let’s find out!

### **Front of the Phone**

When I looked at the front of the phone for the first time, I noticed something a bit different. It looked like the screen was just a tad taller and the edges of the phone looked more squared. When you look at the specs you can see that is in fact true. The Note 9s screen is 6.4” while the Note 8 has a very similar 6.3” screen. This also comes out in the screen-to-body ratio. The Note 8 has an 82.98% but the Note 9 has an 83.51% which is very similar. The panels are the same super AMOLED 1440p that is a tried and true screen and it just looks fantastic! The two fronts are very similar.

### **Back of the Phone**

There are two things you notice immediately. First, the fingerprint sensor is now located under the dual cameras. Also, there is a colored glass over the cameras that are the same color as the phone color you purchase. Previously on the Note 8, it was clear.

### **Cameras**

The cameras on the Note 9 have some welcoming features and specs that the Note 8 does not. First up, variable aperture. This feature was first seen on the Galaxy S9 and S9+ and now on the Note 9. The two different aperture settings are F1.5 and F2.4. The video specs are have also improved.

#### The video specs are:

- 3840x2160 (4K) at 30fps.
- 1920x1080 (1080p HD) at 60fps.
- 1280x720 (720p HD) at 240fps.

#### The Note 9 takes it a step further with:

- 3840x2160 (4K) at 60fps.
- 1920x1080 (1080p HD) at 240fps.
- 1280x720 (720p HD) at 960fps.

The front facing camera is still the same as the Note 8.

### Design

The Note lineup has always been producing large phones. The Note 9 got a little size increase from the Note 8 but small enough to not notice. The Note 9 also gained some weight but again, too little to notice.

Where the fun begins for the Note 9 is the colors (U.S. only). There are four colors available for the new Note 9. Midnight Black, which was also an option on the Note 8. Ocean Blue, which is similar to Deep Sea Blue on the Note 8. Lavender Purple and Metallic Copper are also on the Note 9. The Note 8 had the colors Midnight Black, Deep Sea Blue, Orchid Gray, and Maple Gold. Other than that, the build and design are very similar to each other.

### **Hardware and Performance**

Like the S8 to the S9, the Note 9 has a nice performance bump. The Note 9 has RAM options from 6GB and 8GB while the Note 8 had 6GB. One selling point that Samsung pointed out at their release event was that the Note 9 would be the first phone to have 1TB of storage.

The two storage options are 128GB and 512GB. When Samsung launches there 512GB micro SD, you will be able to put it in the 512GB Note 9 to make a 1TB phone. The storage options for the Note 8 were 64GB. Not that close to the Note 9. The Note 9 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 which does perform better than the Note 8s Snapdragon 835. Although the Note 8 had a battery size of 3300mAh, the Note 9 expanded that to a whopping 400mAh battery. It truly is an “all-day battery”.

With 38 hours talk time and 12 days standby, this is quite impressive. The Note 9 is not very similar in this category because it has to keep up with time.

### The New S Pen

The new S Pen has a great new feature that is going to make the Note 9 just that much better. It now doubles as a Bluetooth remote. It still works as a normal S Pen but it now can pause/play, shutter button, etc. It wirelessly charges while in the phone. While inside the phone, the battery only takes 45 seconds to fully charge for a 30 minute life span. The S Pen will work as a normal stylus when the battery is dead. All of the colors correspond to the color of the phone besides the Ocean Blue Note 9. The Ocean Blue color comes with a yellow S Pen. I personally think it looks good.

So it looks like Note 9 is a different phone, but on the inside. Would I recommend the Note 9? Well that is complicated. The Note 9 is an expensive phone that starts at $999.99 and can get to $1249.99. I you have that much money to spend on a phone, then yes, the Note 9 is a great phone made by a great company. [If you pre-order the Note 9 by August 23rd, you get free AKG Noise Canceling Headphones or the limited Samsung Galaxy Fortnite skin with 15,00 V-Bucks or both for $99.99](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-note9/).
